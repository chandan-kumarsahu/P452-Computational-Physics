# P346 Computational-Physics (Fall 2021) NISER
This directory contains the codes, methods and assignments taught in course P346 Computational physics lab 2021 in NISER Bhubaneswar.

The codes require minimum use of python libraries serve the purpose of basic start to computational methods in physics and maths.

To run the codes, you require the file "CPL_Library.ipynb". This file contains all the functions required code buts to execute the assignmants.
Importing may require different ssytem requirements. This assignmnet pavkage uses inline run for the library functions.
